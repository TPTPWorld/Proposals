<title>Algebraic Data Types</title>
<h1>Algebraic Data Types</h1>
by Petra Hozzov&aacute;, Geoff Sutcliffe, and Michael Rawson.

<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>
<em>Algebraic data types</em> (ADTs, see also: <em>term algebras</em>, <em>inductive data types</em>, and <em>Herbrand universes</em>. Not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type">Abstract Data Types</a>.) are sorts with a specific interpretation.
Members of the sort are built from a fixed set of user-provided <em>constructors</em>.
ADTs are useful for representing objects from functional programming such as lists or trees, and also from mathematics, such as the natural numbers.
See elsewhere [<a href="https://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=KRV17">KRV17</a>, <a href="https://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=BPR18">BPR18</a>] for more background material on ADTs in the context of ATP.

<h3>Examples</h3>
The natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3... can be defined as a sort where every term is either
<ul>
 <li><code>zero</code>, or
 <li><code>succ(N)</code>, where N is itself a natural number.
</ul>
<p>
<code>succ</code> could be read as "successor", N + 1, so that 0 is defined as <code>zero</code>, 1 as <code>succ(zero)</code>, 2 as <code>succ(succ(zero))</code>, and so on.

<p>
In a similar way, lists can be defined as either the nil list or a cons cell containing an element and the tail of a list.
This is a natural example of a polymorphic datatype, as we didn't say what the element sort is.

<p>
ADTs are often (but not always) self-referential, in the sense that larger terms are built from smaller terms of the same sort and an appropriate constructor.

<h3>Definition</h3>
An ADT <em>A</em> is defined by a finite non-empty set of constructors.
Each constructor <em>C</em> maps zero or more arguments of any type (including <em>A</em>) into <em>A</em>.
The sort <em>A</em> is inhabited only by terms induced by these constructors.
Each term is distinct from any other.
<em>A</em> must be non-empty, as usual.

<h2>Proposal</h2>
We propose extending the typed first-order and higher-order languages of the TPTP with ADTs.
We re-use existing syntax as far as possible ADT constructs in order that new syntax, cognitive load and implementation effort are minimised.
<h3>By Example</h3>
We first present the new syntax and semantics by example.
Consider the natural numbers as defined above.
<pre>
tff(nat_type, type-datatype, nat : $tType).
tff(zero_type, type-datatype_constructor, zero : nat).
tff(successor_type, type-datatype_constructor, succ : nat > nat).
</pre>
<b>TODO</b> consider shorter role names: <code>type-adt</code> and <code>type-adtc</code>?

<p>
Here we define the type of natural numbers and two constructors.
Note the use of the sub-roles <code>type-datatype</code> and <code>type-datatype_constructor</code> of the existing <code>type</code> role.
This indicates to the theorem prover that a certain type declaration should be considered an ADT or an ADT constructor respectively.

<p>
ADT <em>testers</em> and <em>destructors</em> can be defined in the language itself:
<pre>
% check for zero
tff(is_zero_type, type, is_zero : nat > $o).
tff(zero_is_zero, axiom, is_zero(zero)).
tff(succ_is_not_zero, axiom, ![X : nat]: ~is_zero(succ(X))).

% check for successor
tff(is_succ_type, type, is_succ : nat > $o).
tff(zero_is_not_succ, axiom, ~is_succ(zero)).
tff(succ_is_succ, axiom, ![X : nat]: is_succ(succ(X))).

% get the predecessor of a number, if it exists
tff(pred_type, type, pred : nat > nat).
tff(pred_succ, axiom, ![X : nat]: pred(succ(X)) = X).
</pre>

<p>
We draw attention to the fact that <code>pred</code> is a <code>type</code>, not a 
<code>type-datatype_constructor</code>: it needs to be a free function, not part of the ADT itself.
At present such testers and destructors are user-provided, but a future proposal may require the system to define these automatically.

<p>
With this, we can already give a conjecture that is provable only with ADT semantics.
<pre>
tff(all_nats_zero_or_succ, conjecture, ![X : nat]: is_zero(X) | is_succ(X)).
</pre>
<p>
This relies on the theorem prover reasoning that all natural numbers are either zero or the successor a natural number.
Similarly:
<pre>
tff(no_cyclic_nats, conjecture, ~?[X : nat]: X = succ(X)).
tff(succ_injective, conjecture, ![X : nat, Y : nat]: X != Y => succ(X) != succ(Y)).
</pre>
<p>
Again, these are not theorems without ADT semantics.

<pre>
tff(add_type, type, plus : nat * nat > nat).
tff(add_zero, axiom, ![X : nat]: plus(X, zero) = X).
tff(add_succ, axiom, ![X : nat, Y : nat]: plus(X, succ(Y)) = succ(plus(X, Y))).
tff(add_commutative, conjecture, ![X : nat, Y : nat]: plus(X, Y) = plus(Y, X)).
</pre>
<p>
Finally, the above conjecture requires the theorem prover to reason inductively.
It is of course possible to combine ADTs with other parts of TPTP such as arithmetic:
<pre>
tff(nat2int_type, type, nat2int : nat > int).
tff(nat2int_zero, type, nat2int(zero) = 0).
tff(nat2int_succ, type, ![X : nat]: nat2int(succ(X)) = nat2int(X) + 1).
</pre>
<b>TODO</b> more examples with e.g. HOL, FOOL, non-classical?

<h3>The <code>type-datatype</code> Role</h3>
A new ADT sort <code>a_type</code> can be introduced in the same way as an uninterpreted sort, 
i.e. a <code>type</code> declaration that declares <code>a_type : $tType</code>.
However, the <code>type-datatype</code> role is used to signal the intended semantics.
Systems should process this in the same way as a <code>type</code> declaration, but flag 
<code>a_type</code> as an ADT internally.
ADTs can be polymorphic, and this is also supported in TPTP by declaring a type constructor:
<pre>
tff(list_type, type-datatype, list : $tType > $tType).
</pre>

<h3>The <code>type-datatype_constructor</code> Role</h3>
A new ADT constructor <code>constr</code> can be introduced in the same way as a function, i.e. a <code>type</code> declaration mapping into <code>a_type</code>.
However, the <code>type-datatype_constructor</code> role is used to signal the intended semantics.
Systems should process this in the same way as a <code>type</code> declaration, but flag <code>constr</code> as an ADT constructor for <code>a_type</code> internally.
Polymorphism works naturally:
<pre>
tff(nil_type, type-datatype_constructor, nil : !>[A : $tType]: A > list(A)).
tff(cons_type, type-datatype_constructor, cons : !>[A : $tType]: A * list(A) > list(A)).
</pre>

<p>
The associated ADT for a constructor can be determined uniquely by the type constructor it maps into.
The ADT should have been declared with <code>type-datatype</code>, and systems should signal <code>SZS status SemanticError</code> if it is not.
In the polymorphic case, it is malformed for a <code>type-datatype_constructor</code> to map into a type variable, and systems should likewise signal <code>SemanticError</code> on inputs of the form
<pre>
tff(who_do_I_belong_to, type-datatype_constructor, confused : !>[X : $tType]: X).
</pre>

Type variables should generally be repeated verbatim in the constructors of polymorphic ADTs:
<pre>
/* Below corresponds to Coq
Inductive sum (A B:Type) : Type :=
  | inl : A -> sum A B
  | inr : B -> sum A B.
*/

% OK
tff(sum_type, type-datatype, sum : ($tType * $tType) > $tType).
tff(inl_type, type-datatype_constructor, inl : !>[A : $tType, B : $tType]: A > sum(A, B)).
tff(inr_type, type-datatype_constructor, inr : !>[A : $tType, B : $tType]: B > sum(A, B)).

% probably not intended but permissible
tff(sum_type, type-datatype, sum : ($tType * $tType) > $tType).
tff(inl_type, type-datatype_constructor, inl : !>[A : $tType, B : $tType]: B > sum(B, A)).
tff(inr_type, type-datatype_constructor, inr : !>[A : $tType, B : $tType]: A > sum(B, A)).
</pre>
but deviating from this is <em>not</em> necessarily an error (see <a href="#GADTs">Generalized ADTs</a>) and systems that do not support such deviations should report <code>SZS status Inappropriate</code>.

<h3>A Hazard with ADT declarations</h3>
As an ADT's sort and constructors are declared separately, it is not possible to determine the complete ADT until a system has loaded a complete problem.
This is because an extra constructor may in theory be added at any point.
We encourage system developers to embrace this situation, while simultaneously advising users to <b>group declarations of an ADT and its constructors together</b>.
This is a slightly-unfortunate consequence of re-using existing syntax: we do not expect it to be a problem in practice.

<p>
The interaction of this proposal and extra-logical statements such as selective include directives and TPI commands is unclear: ADTs should be considered as an indivisible unit, declared together in the same file.

<h3>Checking for Inhabited Sorts</h3>
Systems should check that ADT sorts are inhabited, otherwise any reported results are likely nonsense.
If a sort turns out to be uninhabited, the system should report <code>SZS status SemanticError</code> with a suitable message.
For example, both sorts in
<pre>
tff(void_type, type-datatype, void : $tType).

tff(list_type, type-datatype, list : $tType > $tType).
% whoops, forgot nil
tff(cons_type, type-datatype_constructor, cons : !>[A : $tType]: (A * list(A)) > list(A)).
</pre>
should trigger an error.

<h3>Breakage of Existing Systems</h3>
Existing theorem provers may well treat the new <code>type</code> sub-roles as normal <code>type</code> declarations.
This will <em>reduce</em> the logical strength of the input, which may result in a previously-correct system claiming a theorem is a non-theorem.
Developers of systems affected by this could:
<ul>
 <li>signal <code>SZS status Inappropriate</code> on encountering one of the new <code>type</code> sub-roles; or
 <li>treat the symbols as uninterpreted, reporting incompleteness where appropriate; or
 <li>implement support for ADTs
</ul>
in ascending order of preference. ;-)

<h2>Problems and Systems</h2>
<p>
Problems can be imported from existing libraries, including TIP [<a href="https://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=CJ+15">CJ+15</a>] and Vampire's <a href="https://github.com/vprover/inductive_benchmarks">inductive benchmarks</a>. ITP systems are likely to produce ADT inputs if the language supports it.

<p>
Systems are presently more sparse. Vampire supports much of this proposal already, but will need adapting for the new syntax. Some SMT solvers support a theory of data types, including Z3 or cvc5.

<hr>

<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
The above should suffice for the casual user and implementer of ADTs.
However, there are some interesting corners that merit further discussion.

<h3>Induction</h3>
Some ADT theorems may require the system to employ inductive reasoning, or similar techniques.
Neither TPTP syntax nor semantics make any reference to this: induction is a system-level technique that is independent of ADTs (and indeed may be applied to other theories or even plain logic).
However, a new flag will be added to the header of problems in the TPTP library that are thought to require induction.
<b>TODO</b> how precisely?
This flag may be removed if a non-inductive proof is found.
<b>TODO</b> perhaps it makes more sense to have a "no induction needed" flag?
Systems that use induction should report induction schemata, in the same way as theory axioms in proofs.

<h3>Mutually-Recursive ADTs</h3>
Mutually-recursive ADTs are allowed, but they require a particular order of declaration in order to avoid undeclared types.
Consider enforcing colour alternation in red-black trees:
<pre>
/* Corresponds to Standard ML
datatype 'a red =
    rLeaf of 'a
  | rBranch of 'a black * 'a black
and      'a black =
    bLeaf of 'a
  | bBranch of 'a red * 'a red
*/

% declare types first
tff(red_type, type-datatype, red : $tType > $tType).
tff(black_type, type-datatype, black : $tType > $tType).

% types have been declared now, any order works
tff(rLeaf_type, type-datatype_const, rLeaf : !>[A : $tType]: A > red(A)).
tff(rBranch_type, type-datatype_const, rBranch : !>[A : $tType]: (black(A) * black(A)) > red(A)).
tff(bLeaf_type, type-datatype_const, bLeaf : !>[A : $tType]: A > black(A)).
tff(bBranch_type, type-datatype_const, rBranch : !>[A : $tType]: (red(A) * red(A)) > black(A)).
</pre>

<h3>ADTs and Higher-Order Logic</h3>
Constructors with a function type in their domain are legal.
Consider the following embedding of simply-typed &lambda;-calculus into HOL using higher-order abstract syntax:
<pre>
/*
Following corresponds to the Standard ML
datatype 'a expr =
    eVar of 'a
  | eApp of 'a expr * 'a expr
  | eLam of 'a -> 'a expr
*/

thf(expr_type, type-datatype, expr : $tType > $tType).
thf(eVar_type, type-datatype_constructor, eVar : !>[A : $tType]: A > expr(A)).
thf(eApp_type, type-datatype_constructor, eApp : !>[A : $tType]: (expr(A) * expr(A)) > expr(A)).
thf(eLam_type, type-datatype_constructor, eLam : !>[A : $tType]: (A > expr(A)) > expr(A)).
</pre>

<h3 id="GADTs">Generalized ADTs</h3>
The proposed syntax permits a polymorphic ADT with constructors that instantiate (or permute) arguments of the type constructor in their range.
This is what functional programmers refer to as <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Generalised_algebraic_datatype"><em>Generalized</em> ADTs</a>.
We see no reason to forbid this in TPTP, but note that system support is likely to be patchy.

<h3>Dependently-Typed ADTs</h3>
ADTs can also be dependently-typed, incluing the well-known 'vector' example.
<pre>
tff(vec_type, type-datatype, vec : (nat * $tType) > $tType).
tff(nil_type, type-datatype_constructor, nil : !>[A : $tType]: vec(zero, A)).
tff(cons_type, type-datatype_constructor, cons : !>[N : nat, A : $tType]: (A * vec(N, A)) > vec(succ(N), A)).
</pre>
<b>TODO</b> check this with Cezary?

<h3>Codatatypes</h3>
Codatatypes are a similar concept and will likely use similar syntax in a future proposal.
Systems that implement codatatypes as an extension should use the datatype syntax as a starting point to minimise later effort.

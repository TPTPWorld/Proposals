A collection of choice problems in the context of fixed-length lists. Provided is a short
explanation of each problem:

dchoice_list_empty.p:
Defines the predicate empty and shows that choosing the empty list satisfies the predicate.

dchoice_list_nonempty.p:
As above, but the inverse case of choosing a non-empty list to establish that it doesn't
fulfill the empty-predicate.

dchoice_list_hd.p:
Introduces the unfailing head function on fixed length lists of length >= 1 and states that the
head of a list with first element 0 is 0.

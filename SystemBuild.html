<H3> Motivation </H3>

Over the years of supporting ATP system development (the TSTP, SystemOnTPTP, CASC, etc.), I've 
spent many hours compiling and installing ATP systems, and some of the build processes are 
attriciously complex. 
This proposal aims to set conventions that will make it easy to build ATP systems, which if 
adopted will make life much better for ATP users.
Commonly adopted conventions will allow users to follow the same pattern of activities when 
installing multiple ATP systems.
<P>
<HR><!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<H3> Directory Layout </H3>

The system must unpack into a single directory named after the system and the system version.
The suggested format is the system name written in the normal camel-case that would be used in a 
publication, followed by three hyphens and then the version number, e.g., <TT>Vampire---2.6</TT>, 
<TT>iProver---0.99</TT>.
This format allows for easy extraction of the two components (because only a crazy person would 
have three hyphens as part of their system name or version number).
<P>
<HR><!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<H3> Build Commands </H3>

The build sequence is one used by many open source software packages.
<P>
<TT>    ./configure </TT>&lt;options><BR>
<TT>    make</TT><BR>
<TT>    make install</TT>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <TT>configure</TT> configures the system to run on the current platform. 
     This includes specifying where the executables, library files, and man pages (if any) will 
     be installed, and provide system specific build parameters.
     The minimal &lt;option>s that must be supported are:
     <UL>
     <LI> <TT>--help</TT> : 
          Print this help.
     <LI> <TT>--bindir=</TT>&lt;path> : 
          Specify the directory for executables.
     <LI> <TT>--libdir=</TT>&lt;path> : 
          Specify the directory for library files that are needed for execution.
     <LI> <TT>--exec-prefix=</TT>&lt;path> : 
          Equivalent to <TT>--bindir=</TT>&lt;path><TT>/bin</TT>
                        <TT>--libdir=</TT>&lt;path><TT>/lib</TT>.
     <LI> <TT>--mandir=</TT>&lt;path> : 
          Specify directory for the man pages.
     <LI> <TT>--prefix=</TT>&lt;path> : 
          Equivalent to <TT>--bindir=</TT>&lt;path><TT>/bin</TT>
                        <TT>--libdir=</TT>&lt;path><TT>/lib</TT>
                        <TT>--mandir=</TT>&lt;path><TT>/man</TT>.
     </UL>
     The default is equivalent to <TT>--prefix=/usr/local</TT>
     <P>
     Many ATP systems rely on the use of other ATP systems as external subsystems, e.g., some 
     instantiation-based systems use an external propositional system, and some higher order 
     systems delegate subproblems to first-order subsystems.
     Other ATP systems rely on other external software, e.g., some systems need to know the 
     location of a Prolog interpreter.
     It is generally preferable to specify the location of such external software at run time, as 
     command line parameters.
     If the location of external software (executables, etc.) has to be known at build time, it 
     is recommended that the location be specified by <TT>configure</TT> options of the form:
     <UL>
     <LI> <TT>--use-</TT>&lt;software><TT>=</TT>&lt;path>
     </UL>
     e.g., <TT>--use-eprover=/usr/local/bin/eprover</TT>, or
     <TT>--use-prolog=/usr/bin/swipl</TT>.
     In contrast, the use of resource files in home directories, environment variables, and other 
     approaches that have a global impact on a user account, are discouraged.
<P>
<LI> <TT>make</TT> performs the build. 
     This typically invokes a compiler, etc., but could even be a no-op for interpreted systems.
<P>
<LI> <TT>make install</TT> moves the executables, library files, and man pages into the specified 
     directories. 
     If these directories are not owned by the user, it may be necessary to execute this step as 
     the superuser.
</UL>

for what it's worth, I see no problems with this and would not mind 
adapting to it for the next CASC.

Jens Otten
the goal you want to achieve with this proposal sounds very reasonable
to me. From my own and also Thomas experiences (ILTP/QMLTP) we know
what a pain it can be to get some systems running (I am afraid this
also includes leanCoP-ARDE, where you probably provided a lot of
(or better: too much!) support for this year's CASC; I have never really
tried to install it, so I really don't know; but it did sound complicated).

I am not sure if would make the suggested routine a requirement. E.g.,
for leanCoP the path and the options of the Prolog system call need to be
specified; this needs to be done in the leanCoP shell script anyway. Hence,
this only leaves the path of the prover to be specified (for most people
the default should just work fine, i.e., prover and shell script are in the
same directory). To add two more files to set this path is not really a
lean solution.
 
Anyway, you should be able to install every system within reasonable
efforts. What about a requirement, such as, "Geoff should be able to run
the installation routine within 2 minutes (excluding compiling times)".

Damien Doligez
I think the proposal is quite reasonable, and making your life
easier is a worthy goal, especially considering it will benefit
the users and the packagers as well.

Mario Frank
I support standardization. Thus, I like the proposal for system
building satandards.

But the option --libdir does not make sense for all ATP systems. Some
do not use library files. Should the option be implemented nevertheless?

Chris Benzmueller
I discussed the proposal with Nik and we think that LEO-II can fulfill
these requirements starting from the next release.

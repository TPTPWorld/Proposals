<H3> The TPI Language </H3>

The language used to express TPI commands has the same look-and-feel as the TPTP language used to 
write logical formulae (only minor modifications need to be made to an existing parser for the TPTP 
language in order to read TPI commands).
The TPI language is used alongside the existing logical TPTP language forms (THF, TFF, FOF, CNF) 
to provide command and control instructions for manipulating logical formulae in the context of 
ATP systems.
TPI command formulae can be input to an ATP system, or can be input to an interpreter that has no 
reasoning capabilities and instead invokes external ATP systems.
In either case a system that can process TPI commands is referred to as a <EM>TPI system</EM>, 
i.e., an ATP system that can process TPI commands is a type of TPI system.
<P>
Input to a TPI system can contain both logical formulae and TPI command formulae.
The two types of formulae are processed together, in the order they appear in the file.
(This makes the order of the formulae relevant, which is counter to the TPTP principle that 
formulae can be reordered, cut-and-pasted, merged, etc.
However, TPI command formulae are non-logical, so this deviation from the principle seems 
tolerable.)
Logical formulae are processed and stored as usual, and command formulae are obeyed.
<P>
The logical formulae that have been processed and stored by a TPI system are initially in an 
<EM>active</EM> state.
Logical formulae can be "deactivated", placing them into an <EM>inactive</EM> state, so that they 
do not appear to exist.
Inactive formulae are not used in any processing.
Inactive logical formulae can be "activated" so that they are again used in processing.
In addition to being active or inactive, logical formulae also belong to one or more named 
<EM>groups</EM>.
All logical formulae belong to the group <TT>tpi</TT>, all premises (<TT>axiom</TT>s, 
<TT>hypothesis</TT>s, <TT>definition</TT>s, <TT>lemma</TT>s, etc.) belong to the group 
<TT>tpi_premises</TT>, all <TT>conjecture</TT>s and <TT>negated_conjecture</TT>s belong to the 
group <TT>tpi_conjectures</TT>,
and all logical formulae can belong to multiple other user-defined groups.
The TPI language provides commands for manipulating groups of logical formulae.
<P>
<HR><!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<H3> TPI Command Formulae </H3>

TPI uses a new TPTP language form, <TT>tpi</TT>. 
TPI command formulae are structurally almost the same as the logical language forms:<BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tpi(</TT><EM>Name</EM><TT>,</TT><EM>Command</EM><TT>,</TT><EM>CommandDetails</EM><TT>,</TT><EM>Source</EM><TT>,</TT><EM>UsefulInfo</EM><TT>).</TT><BR>
An example of a TPI command formula is
<PRE>
    tpi(1,execute,'SZS_STATUS' = 'E---1.6/eprover --auto --cpu-limit=$getargv(0) --tstp-format $getgroups(tpi)').
</PRE>
<P>
Using non-terminals from the <A HREF="https://tptp.org/UserDocs/TPTPLanguage/SyntaxBNF.html">
TPTP syntax</A>, each <EM>Command</EM> is an <TT>&lt;atomic_word></TT>, and <EM>CommandDetails</EM> 
is either a <TT>&lt;proposition></TT>, a <TT>&lt;defined_infix_formula></TT> in the form of an 
equality, or a <TT>&lt;fol_infix_unary>.</TT> in the form of an inequality.
This use of existing TPTP syntax makes it easy to modify an existing parser
for the TPTP language to read TPI commands.
The <EM>Source</EM> and <EM>UsefulInfo</EM> are optional as usual.
<P>
In order for a command's <EM>CommandDetails</EM> to be parsed as a
<TT>&lt;proposition></TT>, <TT>&lt;defined_infix_formula></TT>, or
<TT>&lt;fol_infix_unary>.</TT>, it is often necessary to quote the whole 
<EM>CommandDetails</EM> or the operands of the (in)equality.
For example, the lefthand side of the equality that forms the
<EM>CommandDetails</EM> of the example TPI command above is
an environment variable that starts with an uppercase letter.
It has to be quoted so that a TPTP parser does not interpret it as a logic
variable.
<P>
TPI command formulae can use three new TPTP interpreted functors:
<UL>
<LI> <TT>$getargv(</TT><EM>Index</EM><TT>)</TT> -
     Evaluates to the command line argument of the TPI system, with 
     <EM>Index</EM> 0 referring to the argument after the name of the TPI
     file being processed (this might be an indicator of <TT>stdin</TT>
     or a regular file name).
<LI> <TT>$getenv(</TT><EM>Name</EM><TT>)</TT> -
     Evaluates to the value of the environment value <EM>Name</EM>.
     If <EM>Name</EM> is not set it evaluates to an empty string.
<LI> <TT>$getgroups(</TT><EM>Group name</EM><TT>,</TT><EM>Group name</EM><TT>,</TT><EM>Group name</EM> ... <TT>)</TT> -
     Evaluates to the name of a temporary file containing all the active
     logical formulae in the named groups.
     If a formulae is in multiple of the groups, it appears in the file 
     multiple times.
</UL>
<P>
An example of TPI command formulae interleaved with logical formulae is:
<PRE>
    tpi(1,input,'Axioms/SET006+0.ax').
    fof(thI14,conjecture,
        ( ! [A] : equal_set(union(A,A),A) )).
    tpi(2,execute,
        'SZS_STATUS' = 'E---1.6/eprover --auto --cpu-limit=$getargv(0) --tstp-format $getgroups(tpi)').
    tpi(3,write,'Status: ' & $getenv('SZS_STATUS')).
    tpi(4,exit,exit(27)).
</PRE>

With those formulae in an input file named <TT>Simple.p</TT>, a TPI system
would be invoked like this:
<PRE>
    my_tpi_system Simple.p 300
</PRE>
The first line reads in a file of axioms, after which a conjecture is
provided.
The third line invokes the ATP system E, with a 300s CPU time
limit taken from the command line.
The <A HREF="http://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=Documents&File=SZSOntology">SZS status</A> is stored in the environment
variable <TT>SZS_STATUS</TT>.
The fourth line writes that status to <TT>stdout</TT>,
after which the last lines ends the processing.

     Action: Inputs the named file.
             The logical formulae in the file are put in the named group
             if one is specified (it's the same as putting a

     <TT>&lt;environment_variable> &lt;infix_equality> &lt;atomic_value></TT>
     <P>
     Action: Sets the environment variable to the atomic value.
             An expected use of environment variables is to pass values to
             ATP systems run through <TT>execute</TT> commands - see below.
     <P>
     Examples:<BR>
     <TT>tpi(1,setenv,'TPTP' = '/home/geoff/tptp/TPTP').</TT><BR>
     <TT>tpi(2,setenv,'CPU_LIMIT' = 300).</TT>

     Action: Waits for an environment variable to become set.
             The <TT>&lt;environment_variables></TT> can be a single
             environment variable, or a disjunction in which case the
             TPI system waits for any one of them to become set.
             A main use of <TT>waitenv</TT> is to coordinate with
             <TT>execute_async</TT> commands - see below.
     <P>
     Examples:<BR>
     <TT>tpi(1,waitenv,'ASYNC_SZS_STATUS').</TT><BR>
     <TT>tpi(2,waitenv,'EP_SZS_STATUS' | 'VAMPIRE_SZS_STATUS').</TT>

<DT> <TT>mktemp</TT>
<DD> <EM>CommandDetails:</EM>
     <TT>&lt;environment_variable></TT>
     <P>
     Action: Creates a new temporary file and places the name of the file
             in the environment variable.
             All temporary files created this way are deleted when a
             <TT>clean</TT> command is executed.
     <P>

     <TT>tpi(1,mktemp,'TEMP_FILENAME').</TT>

<DT> <TT>set_logic</TT>
<DD> <EM>CommandDetails:</EM>
     <TT>&lt;logic_specification></TT>
     <P>
     Action: Sets the logic/semantics within which the active logical formulae
             should be processed.

<DT> <TT>execute</TT>
<DD> <EM>CommandDetails:</EM>
     [<TT>&lt;environment_variable> &lt;infix_equality></TT>] <TT>self</TT> | <TT>&lt;command></TT>
     <P>
     Action: If the argument is <TT>self</TT> then the TPI system processes all
             the active logical formulae using its own reasoning process.
             Thus <TT>execute,self</TT> is meaningful only in the context of an
             ATP system, which runs its reasoning process on all the active 
             logical formulae.
             If the argument is an <TT>&lt;command></TT> then any embedded 
             <TT>$get</TT><EM>*</EM> terms are replaced by the corresponding 
             values, and the resulting <TT>&lt;command></TT> is executed.
             If the optional equation is provided, the SZS status from 
             reasoning is placed into the environment variable.
             The TPI system waits for the execution to complete.
             <P>
             For backward compatibility, a <TT>%s</TT> in an 
             <TT>&lt;command></TT> is equivalent to 
             <TT>$getgroups(tpi)</TT>.
             Note that <TT>execute</TT> can be used to run arbitrary commands,
             e.g., <TT>/bin/date</TT> to output the date and time.
             <P>
             When a TPI system is reading the top level file, i.e., not an
             <TT>include</TT>d or <TT>input</TT> file, if it reaches the end of
             the file without finding an <TT>exit</TT> command then an implicit
             <TT>execute,self</TT> is performed.
             Thus a conventional ATP system that is given a file of
             logical formulae as its input, and runs its reasoning process
             on the logical formulae after reading the complete file, is a
             TPI system.

     Action: Runs like <TT>execute</TT>, but processing of the current TPI file 
             continues concurrently with the execution.
             All processes created this way are terminated when a
             <TT>clean</TT> command is executed.
     <P>
     Examples:<BR>

             As such a <TT>filter</TT> is equivalent to a sequence such as:

========================================================================
I had a few thoughts about the generic ATP control instructions that
could be added to the TPI language, in the final part of your work
for your MS. Once we have a full set you can then also do an evaluation
of the ATP system under all combijations of values for the controls.
So far ...

+ Use/don't use axiom selection
+ Search forward/backwards
+ Use DFS/BFS/heuristic/ratio search
+ Use KBO/LPO for equality

In all cases we'd use the default configuration of the ATP system for
each value of each option.

<H3> Example Applications </H3>

The following is a simplest example, showing how axioms can be input and used with
a conjecture by virtue of an implicit <TT>execute,self</TT>.
Command 1 inputs the file of axioms, then another axiom and a conjecture 
are provided, after which the TPI system (necessarily an ATP system)
starts it's reasoning process by virtue of the implicit <TT>execute,self</TT>
at the end of file.
<PRE>
    tpi(1,input,'Axioms/SYN001+1.ax').
    fof(another,axiom,pp => qq).
    fof(a,conjecture,qq).

The following example shows how some common core axioms (in <TT>SYN001+1.ax</TT>)
can be loaded, then used in conjunction with different conjecture-specific
axioms using explicit <TT>execute,self</TT>s.
Command 1 inputs a file of axioms, after which command 2 starts a group 
named <TT>try_these</TT>. 
Another axiom and a conjecture are put into the group, which is ended by
command 3.
Command 4 starts the TPI system's (necessarily an ATP system) reasoning 
process.
After the execution is completed command 5 deletes the axiom and conjecture 
in the group, and yet another axiom and another conjecture are provided.
The axioms that were input from the file also remain.
Command 6 starts the TPI system's reasoning process again. 
When execution is completed command 7 stops the TPI system.

The following example shows how different groups of axioms can be used with a
conjecture.
Commands 1 and 2 start two groups of axioms.
Command 3 loads the axioms that are unique to the old group, after which
command 4 starts the group of new axioms.
Command 5 loads axioms that are common to the old and new groups,
command 6 ends the old group,
command 7 loads axioms that are unique to the new group,
and commands 8 and 9 end the groups.
Command 10 loads another set of axioms, which are part of only the {\tt tpi}
group.
Commands 11 and 12 put the conjecture into a group.
The next eight pairs of commands try prove the conjecture from various
combinations of the axioms, and report the results.
Commands 13 and 14 use just the old axioms,
commands 15 and 16 use just the new axioms,
commands 17 and 18 use both the old and new axioms,
and finally commands 19 and 20 use all the available axioms.
When execution is completed command 21 stops the TPI system.

The following example shows how to check the axioms for satisfiability before
making a proof attempt.
Two axioms are provided, after which command 1 invokes the Paradox ATP
system to establish that the axioms are satisfiable.
Command 2 writes the SZS status returned by Paradox, and command 3 asserts
that the status must be <TT>Satisfiable</TT> (it obviously is).
A conjecture is then provided, and command 4 invokes the E ATP system to
prove it's a theorem.
Command 5 writes the SZS status returned by E, after which command 6 stops 
the TPI system.

The following example shows how a proved conjecture can be used as a lemma for a
subsequent conjecture.
It also (somewhat redundantly) illustrates deactivation and activation
of logical formulae.
The first two axioms are loaded as a group. 
The third axiom is not necessary for proving the subsequent conjecture,
so it is deactivated before command 4 proves the conjecture from the 
first two axioms.
Commands 5 and 6 write and verify the result.
Command 7 changes the role of the proved conjecture to a lemma (i.e., it
can be used like an axiom), command 8 activates the necessary axiom,
command 9 deactivates the first two axioms, and a new conjecture is loaded.
Command 10 proves the new conjecture, and command 11 writes out the result.
Command 12 stops the TPI system.

The following example shows how the logical formulae can be filtered.
Command 1 inputs a file containing a large theory problem, i.e., the file
contains a conjecture and very many axioms of which only a few are necessary 
for a proof.
Command 2 inputs some extra axioms.
Command 3 invokes the E ATP system asynchronously to try to prove the
conjecture from all the axioms (the <TT>--satauto</TT> option supresses E's 
internal axiom selection process).
While E is running command 5 invokes the SInE system to select the axioms 
from the <TT>lt_problem</TT> group that are expected to be necessary for a 
proof, replacing the very many axioms in the group by the selected axioms 
(the conjecture is also retained by SInE).
The selected axioms and the conjecture are placed in the <TT>sine_problem</TT>
group by commands 4 and 6.
Command 7 outputs the selected axioms and conjecture to the file
<TT>SInEProblem.p</TT>.
Command 8 invokes the E ATP system to prove the conjecture from the selected
axioms.
Command 9 makes the TPI system wait for the first instance of E to complete 
its execution, after which commands 10 and 11 write the SZS statuses returned 
by E.
Command 12 stops the TPI system.

The following example shows how competition parallelism can be implemented.
Command 1 inputs the problem.
Commands 2 and 3 invoke the ATP systems asynchronously to try to prove the 
theorem at the same time.
Command 4 makes the TPI system wait for either of the ATP systems to complete
their execution.
Command 5 writes out the SZS statuses returned by the ATP systems - note that
it is likely that only one of them will have returned a status.
Command 6 stops the TPI system.
This implementation relies on the TPI system stopping the second ATP system
that might still be running when command 6 is executed.

<H3> The TPI Interpreter </H3>

The TPI Interpreter (TPII) is a full interpreter for the TPI command
language, without any reasoning capability - it relies on use of the
<TT>execute</TT> and <TT>execute_async</TT> commands to invoke external
ATP systems.
TPII is written in C, based on the JJParser library, and
is distributed as part of the TPTP World.
TPII is also available online in the 
<A HREF="http://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SystemB4TPTP">SystemB4TPTP interface</A>.
<P>
As part of the TPTP World, the TPII is distributed alongside the
SystemOnTPTP utility that hosts and executes ATP systems in a
flexible way.
TPII's <TT>execute</TT> and <TT>execute_async</TT> commands have been
extended to support direct access to the SystemOnTPTP utility.
If the ATP command starts with a system name in the form
<EM>System</EM><TT>---</TT><EM>Version</EM> then that system will be executed by
the SystemOnTPTP utility.
The <EM>Version</EM> can be empty, in which case the latest version of the
<EM>System</EM> will be used.
The <EM>System</EM><TT>---</TT><EM>Version</EM> must be followed by an 
integer CPU time limit, and a single <TT>$getgroups</TT> term to specify the
formulae to be passed to the SystemOnTPTP utility.
Some examples are:
<PRE>
    tpi(1,execute,'E---1.8 300 $getgroups(tpi)').
    tpi(2,execute,'SZS_STATUS' = 'E--- $getargv(0) $getgroups(axioms,my_conjectures)').
</PRE>

This makes it easy to parameterize the competition parallelism example.
With the TPI commands in a file named <TT>CompPar.tpi</TT>, TPII
would be invoked with
<PRE>
    TPII CompPar.tpi E---1.6 Vampire---2.6 300 Simple.p
</PRE>
The TPI commands in <TT>CompPar.tpi</TT> would be changed to
<PRE>
    tpi(1,input,$getargv(3)).
    tpi(2,execute_async,'SZS_RESULT_1' = '$getargv(0) $getargv(2)').
    tpi(3,execute_async,'SZS_RESULT_2' = '$getargv(1) $getargv(2)').
    tpi(4,waitenv,'SZS_RESULT_1' | 'SZS_RESULT_2').
    tpi(5,write,'$getargv(0) SZS_RESULT = $getenv(SZS_RESULT_1) '
              & '$getargv(1) SZS_RESULT = $getenv(SZS_RESULT_2)').
    tpi(6,exit,exit).
</PRE>

Similarly, the meta-system can be parameterized, by invoking TPII with 
the command line
<PRE>
    TPII Meta.tpi E---1.6 300 Simple.p
</PRE>
and the TPI commands in <TT>Meta.tpi</TT> changed to
<PRE>
    tpi(1,input,$getargv(2)).
    tpi(2,execute,'SZS_VAR' = '$getargv(0) $getargv(1)').
    tpi(3,write,'The SZS status is' & $getenv('SZS_VAR')).
    tpi(4,exit,exit).
</PRE>

For <TT>execute</TT> and <TT>execute_async</TT> commands, TPII scans the
ATP system's output for a line that contains the string "SZS status", which
is the standard prefix for an SZS ontology result.
The first time such a string is found the SZS status is expected to be
the next word in that line.
<P>
TPII is minimally robust against ill-formed input, and exits
if any errors are found.
If there is an error then 1 is returned to the operating system as the exit
status (so this should be avoided as a user exit code).
